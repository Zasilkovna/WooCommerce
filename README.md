#### Filters

WP Filters are used to easily alter preselected system behaviors.

To register filter edit wc-includes/functions.php and add your PHP code after all PHP file includes.

##### Order status filtering

To filter additional orders from Packeta order list when applying Packeta filter, use following sample code.

```
add_filter( 'packetery_exclude_orders_with_status', function (array $statuses): array {
    $statuses[] = 'wc-cancelled';
    return $statuses;
} );
```

##### Packeta price filter

To convert prices at correct moments the Packeta plugin uses WOOCS filter as only solution.
To support other currency switchers please add price converting filter.
For example, to support active CURCY - Multi Currency for WooCommerce plugin, paste following code to ```wp-includes/functions.php``` after all file includes.

```
add_filter( 'packetery_price', function ( float $price ): float {
    return (float) wmc_get_price( $price );
} );
```

##### Filter altering packet attributes

For example, to set the weight of all packets to 1.5 kg, you can use the following code inserted into ```wp-includes/functions.php```.

```
add_filter( 'packeta_create_packet', function ( array $createPacketData ): array {
	$createPacketData['weight'] = 1.5;
	return $createPacketData;
} );
```

You can find description of the attributes in the [official documentation](https://docs.packetery.com/03-creating-packets/06-packetery-api-reference.html#toc-packetattributes).
