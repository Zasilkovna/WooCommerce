== Description ==

This is the official plugin, that allows you to choose pickup points of Packeta and its external carriers in all of Europe, or utilize address delivery to 25 countries in the European Union, straight from the cart in your e-shop. Furthermore, you can also submit all your orders to Packeta with just one click.

* delivery to pickup points of external carriers all over Europe
* the ability to fill in/change the weight and dimensions of the shipment before submitting it to Packeta
* the automatic submission of orders to Packeta
* after submitting an order to Packeta, each order gets an order number, which acts as a link to a URL with the tracking of the parcel
* label printing, including direct labels
* age verification (18+) can be configured individually for each product. The order will then require the customer to verify his age during the parcel pickup
* printing of the list of parcels

== Installation ==

* You can install the plugin either in your WordPress administration: Plugins->Plugin installation->Upload plugin or upload the "packetery" folder into the /wp-content/plugins/ 
* Activate the plugin in the WordPress menu "Plugins"
* Set up the plugin according to our user documentation
* If you update the Packeta plugin manually, you first need to completely delete the "packeta" folder and then upload the folder with the new version of the plugin.
  You should definitely not upgrade by copying the new version to the original folder.
  This could cause the original version to merge with the new one, which can cause the plugin to become completely non-functional.
